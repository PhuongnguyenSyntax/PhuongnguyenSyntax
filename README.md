- 👋 Hi, I’m Flama Henkel
- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of hobbies that bring color to life. I have a passion for gardening, growing flowers that brighten up my space,
      and painting canvases that reflect my vision of the world. Fishing is my go-to for some tranquility,  and I love the adventure that comes
      with traveling in my mobilhome. My interests also extend to language learning and programming — I find joy in the process of mastering new skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming for Android and iOS. It's a fascinating journey...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are at the intersection of technology and creativity. If you’re working on something that combines
      software development with a touch of artistry, I'm all ears...
- 📫 How to reach me ? Drop me a line at flamahenkel@gmail.com. Whether you have a question or just want to share your thoughts, I'm here to connect.
- 😄 Pronouns: In case you're wondering, I use he/him/his or they/them/theirs. It's all about respect and comfort, so please feel free to use whatever you're
     comfortable with!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I firmly believe that it's never too late to learn anything new. Curiosity has no age limit, and every day is a chance to discover something
     fascinating!
